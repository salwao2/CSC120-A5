Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- What are your initial impressions of how `Association` affects your programming?
I think it's really cool how objects behavior together for certain functionalities. I think it's nice to have different classes in different files and then bring them all together and they still work. I really appreciated how orgainzed everything is when you do it this way. It's nice to have a train class, an engine class, a car class, and a passenger class. It makes it so much more clear, cohesive, and intuitive when everything is in its own little section. I also would see this being beneficial for creating reproducible code.

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

I really appreaciated how thorough the instructions were on Github, they were really easy to follow and that helped me when checking off what next steps I needed to take in creating each class. I think something I struggled with boils done to me still learning Java and sometimes thinking of how I would do something in Python, but having to think about how it has to be written in Java. I would advise future students to start early on the labs to have time to write some pseudo code, go to tutoring and office hours, and to leave time for dealing with bugs.
